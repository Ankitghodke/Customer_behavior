## ⚙️ Data Pipeline Workflow

 1. 🔹 Data Engineering & ETL (Python)
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, standardized schema for SQL injection
- **Feature Engineering:** Prepared dataset for relational cloud storage
- **Cloud Integration:** Established secure connection between **Google Colab and Neon Serverless PostgreSQL** — solving the cloud-to-cloud connectivity challenge without a local server

 2. 🔹 Cloud Data Warehousing (SQL)
Solved **10 critical business questions** on the cloud-hosted database:

| Query | Technique | Key Finding |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Revenue by Gender | GROUP BY + SUM | Male: $157,890 vs Female: $75,191 |
| Discount vs High Spenders | Subquery | 1,677 customers (43%) used discounts |
| Top 5 Rated Products | AVG + ORDER BY | Top products identified by avg rating |
| Shipping Type Comparison | GROUP BY + AVG | Express $60.48 vs Standard $58.46 |
| Subscriber Spend Analysis | GROUP BY + COUNT | 1,053 subscribers vs 2,847 non-subscribers |
| Discount Rate by Product | CASE + ROUND | Top 5 discount-heavy products identified |
| Customer Segmentation | CTE + CASE | New (83) \| Returning (701) \| Loyal (3,116) |
| Top 3 Products per Category | CTE + ROW_NUMBER | Window Function ranking across 4 categories |
| Repeat Buyer Subscription | WHERE + GROUP BY | 89.1% of customers are repeat buyers |
| Revenue by Age Group | GROUP BY + SUM | Age-based revenue distribution identified |

 3. 🔹 Business Intelligence (Power BI)
Connected Neon Cloud DB to Power BI for interactive dashboard:
- **Executive KPIs:** Total Revenue, Avg Rating, Subscription Rate, Avg Purchase
- **Operational Insights:** Shipping efficiency, regional sales, category performance
